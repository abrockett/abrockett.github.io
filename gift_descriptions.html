<p><strong>Spiritual Gifts&mdash;One Page Descriptions</strong></p>
<p>A spiritual gift is defined by Scripture (see 1 Corinthians 12; 1 Peter 4; Ephesians 4) as a unique ability given by God through His Holy Spirit to believers in Jesus&mdash;for the purpose of bringing glory to Him and strengthening His church.In addition, spiritual gifts are recognized and affirmed by the Body of Christ, and we see them evidenced in the life of Jesus and ministry of the early church.</p>
<p>This is a list of 23 gifts mentioned or implied in the Bible.ALL are essential to the healthy functioning of the church.ALL need to be exercised in a spirit of love.ALL are given to individual Jesus-followers so that they might glorify God and strengthen the Body of Christ.Spiritual gifts are how God has equipped us to serve Him.God-given gifts make a far greater impact than simply using your own talents and abilities. For further study about gifts, take a look at Romans 12-13, 1 Corinthians 12-14, Ephesians 4, and 1 Peter 2 and 4.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spiritual giftedness is rooted in faith in Jesus.At Pentecost in Acts 2, Peter says &ldquo;Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;God calls us to Himself, we acknowledge our need for Him and come to Him in humility and repentance, receiving His forgiveness and the promise of new life.That new life reflects God&rsquo;s call on the whole of ourselves, and we respond in gratitude and service to Him and to others.God does not simply call us to a life of generosity; He enables us to carry out His call through use of the gifts He gives us.As He promises in Hebrews 13:20-21, He will equip us &ldquo;with everything good for doing His will.&rdquo;And, Peter adds that as we do His will, we are using our gifts, individually and collectively &ldquo;to serve others, as faithful stewards of God&rsquo;s grace in its various forms.&rdquo; (1 Peter 4:10)</p>
<p>We hope that this spiritual gifts assessment helps you not only identify your God-given giftedness, but also starts you on (or helps you continue on) the journey of living into those gifts and further developing and using them.We hope this journey also results in you learning how to better affirm and embrace the gifts of others, especially those you don&rsquo;t have!</p>

<p><strong>Helps </strong></p>
<p>The gift of <strong>Helps</strong> is one that meets the practical needs of others and of the church/organization in order to enhance, support, or accomplish ministry.One attribute of this gift is that many of these servants view &ldquo;helps&rdquo; as such a natural extension of who they are, they have a hard time acknowledging that it is an essential part of the Body of Christ.Other indicators of someone with the gift of helps is that he/she serves willingly, cheerfully, humbly, and wherever needed.They spot needs before others do and are sometimes surprised when other people don&rsquo;t notice the practical behind-the-scenes things that need doing.</p>

<p><strong>Intercession</strong></p>
<p><strong>Intercession</strong>&mdash;interceding, pleading, approaching God on someone else&rsquo;s behalf&mdash;is something we are all to do.People with this gift are those who feel compelled by God to pray on a daily basis for others.They are completely convinced of the awesome power and necessity of prayer.These are the folks you call first about a concern you have, because you <em>know</em> they <em>will </em>pray.Many with this gift are surprised it&rsquo;s a gift&mdash;they think ALL of us pray unceasingly as they do. They know that their faithfulness in prayer for others invites the power and the presence of God into every circumstance, and that prayer is not something to be taken lightly but is a battleground.</p>
